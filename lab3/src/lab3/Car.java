In addition, the class should have the following public methods:

	Constructor: Accepts two arguments. The first argument is the car's year model and
		the second argument is the car's make. These values should be assigned to the yearModel
		and make fields. The constructor should also assign 0 to the speed field.
	getYearModel: A public method that returns the value stored in the yearModel field.
	getMake: A public method that returns the value stored in the make field.
	getSpeed: A public method that returns the value stored in the speed field.
	setYearModel: A public method that accepts an int argument that is assigned to the yearModel
		field. The method returns no value.
	setMake: A public method that accepts a String argument that is assigned to the make field.
		The method returns no value.
	setSpeed: A public method that accepts an int argument that is assigned to the speed field.
		The method returns no value.
	accelerate: A public void method that adds 5 to the speed field.
	brake: A public void method that subtracts 5 from the speed field.
	getDescription: This public method should return the information about the Car instance
		in the form of a String array as given in the following example:
		if yearModel is 2025, make is "Toyota" and speed is 5 then getDescription returns:
		{"This is a 2025 model vehicle.","It is made by Toyota.", "It is cruising at 5 kmph."}
